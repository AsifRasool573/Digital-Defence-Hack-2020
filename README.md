# Digital-Defence-Hack-2020
Winner of Digital Defene Hack 2020 (Anomaly Detection) | 20 - 22 November 2020

I was just practicing my code and building up my interest in Data Analytics with the help of iCodeGuru (www.icode.guru). A guy approached me and asked me to post in iCodeGuru about a Hackathon named as Digital Defense Hack 2021. As I was never knew aobut Hackathons before this, that's why it was very strange for me. But somehow, I discussed this hackathon with Dr. Zafar Shahid (My Mentor from Facebook), he said it's a good chance to excel your interest as well as exposure and building your potfolio. I visited the link of the host of this hackathon, Hackmakers.com.
After gathering necessary details, I introduced my fellows to this hackathon. We were determined to participate in huge number. After registration and joining Slack space of #DigitalDefense Hack 2020, I introduced myself with my soft and technical skills. One of the participant Neda Afzali Seresht contacted me inquiring about finding a team, but we both had the same story, no team. 
After contacting many people, I didn't get the positive repsonse and they didn't let me in their teams. I was about to quite and a random thought came in my mind "Just give one last chance". And I contact the Neda Afzali just ask about if she found a team, then she had a team. I asked for a place, she contact her other team members and they recruited me in their team. All the team members were very polite and nice guys. As stated earlier, it was my first hackathon so I was also a bit hasitating to communicte but they asked to express myself freely. We all agreed to select Anomaly Detection Challenged. In short, we started working on it and worked sleeplessly next 48 hours, we came up with an amazing solution then the thing left was final pitching. Our team lead Robert presented the idea and made a 3 minute video and finally we submitted our work 2 minutes before the dealine and it was a close call.

Result was announced on 6th December 2020 and We were the winner, team name: Black_Caps

you can watch our final pitch on the following link to get in detail idea about our work.
